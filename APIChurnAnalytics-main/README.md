# Challenge Churn Analytics Project

## Overview

This project integrates several advanced functionalities for analyzing and managing customer churn using RESTful APIs, xUnit testing, Clean Code principles, and ML.NET for sentiment analysis.

### Features

- **External API Integration**: Added an `AuthController` that integrates with an external authentication service to validate users via token-based authentication.
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/authenticate`
  - **Description**: Authenticates a user by validating a provided token.

- **Sentiment Analysis with ML.NET**: Added a `SentimentController` for analyzing the sentiment of a given text using ML.NET.
  - **Endpoint**: `POST /api/sentiment/analyze`
  - **Description**: Analyzes the sentiment (positive or negative) of the provided text.

- **Testing with xUnit**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests were implemented using xUnit for key services, such as the `ExternalAuthService` and `SentimentAnalysisService`. This ensures that the application functions correctly in different scenarios.

- **Clean Code and SOLID Principles**: Refactored the codebase following Clean Code and SOLID principles:
  - **Single Responsibility**: Each service and class handles only one specific part of the applicationâ€™s functionality.
  - **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected into controllers and classes, following the Dependency Inversion principle.
  - **Interface Segregation and Open-Closed Principles**: Code is designed to be extensible without modification and adheres to focused interfaces.
